# Copy to .env or .env.production and adjust the URL to where your Node API is hosted
# For local development you typically do NOT set this (Weather.jsx falls back to same-origin or localhost proxy).
# Example for production (Railway / Render / Fly.io / etc):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-weather-backend.example.com
